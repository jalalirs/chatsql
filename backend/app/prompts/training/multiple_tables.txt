Generate {num_questions} natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries using JOIN operations between the following tables: {table_names}.

Tables Schema:
{table_schema}

Available Tables and Columns:
{columns_list}

Guidelines:
- Use Microsoft SQL Server syntax (square brackets for identifiers, TOP N instead of LIMIT)
- Questions should involve JOIN operations between the specified tables
- SQL should be correct and executable with proper JOIN syntax
- Each question must use columns from at least two different tables
- Include a mix of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and complex multi-table queries
- Consider realistic business scenarios that would require joining these tables
- Include filtering, aggregation, and sorting operations
- Ensure proper table aliases and column qualification

IMPORTANT: Return your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{
      "question": "Natural language question here",
      "sql": "SELECT statement with JOIN here",
      "involved_columns": [
        {{
          "table": "table_name",
          "column": "column_name"
        }}
      ],
      "query_type": "join",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    }}
