Generate {num_questions} natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries using ONLY the specified columns from the table: {table_name}.

Table Schema:
{table_schema}

Selected Columns to Use:
{columns_list}

Guidelines:
- Use Microsoft SQL Server syntax (square brackets for identifiers, TOP N instead of LIMIT)
- Questions should be realistic and varied (filtering, aggregation, sorting, etc.)
- SQL should be correct and executable
- Each question must use at least one of the specified columns
- Do NOT use any columns not in the selected columns list
- Include a mix of simple SELECT, WHERE conditions, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions
- Consider the data types and sample values when generating realistic questions

IMPORTANT: Return your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{
      "question": "Natural language question here",
      "sql": "SELECT statement here",
      "involved_columns": [
        {{
          "table": "{table_name}",
          "column": "column_name"
        }}
      ],
      "query_type": "simple_select",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    }}
  ]
}}
