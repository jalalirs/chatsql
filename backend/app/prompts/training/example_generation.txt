Generate {num_examples} natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries for the table: {table_name}.

Table columns:
{columns_text}

Your task is to generate a natural language question and its corresponding SQL query for the table: {table_name}.

Guidelines:
- Use Microsoft SQL Server syntax (square brackets for identifiers, TOP N instead of LIMIT)
- Questions should be realistic and varied (filtering, aggregation, sorting, etc.)
- SQL should be correct and executable
- Include a mix of simple and complex queries
- Use appropriate WHERE clauses, GROUP BY, ORDER BY as needed

Format each example as:
Question: [natural language question]
SQL: [corresponding SQL query]

Generate exactly {num_examples} examples:
