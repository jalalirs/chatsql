Generate {num_questions} natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries using JOIN operations between the following tables, but ONLY using the specified columns: {table_names}.

Tables Schema:
{table_schema}

Selected Tables and Columns to Use:
{columns_list}

Guidelines:
- Use Microsoft SQL Server syntax (square brackets for identifiers, TOP N instead of LIMIT)
- Questions should involve JOIN operations between the specified tables
- SQL should be correct and executable with proper JOIN syntax
- Each question must use columns from at least two different tables
- Do NOT use any columns not in the selected columns list
- Include a mix of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and complex multi-table queries
- Consider realistic business scenarios that would require joining these tables
- Include filtering, aggregation, and sorting operations
- Ensure proper table aliases and column qualification
- Only use the columns specified for each table
