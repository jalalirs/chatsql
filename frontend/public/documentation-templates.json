      "content": "When generating SQL queries for Microsoft SQL Server, always adhere to the following specific syntax and conventions. Unlike other SQL dialects, MS SQL Server uses square brackets [] to delimit identifiers (like table or column names), especially if they are SQL keywords (e.g., [View]) or contain spaces. For limiting the number of rows returned, always use the TOP N clause immediately after the SELECT keyword, ensuring there is a space between TOP and the numerical value (e.g., SELECT TOP 5 Company_Name). The LIMIT and OFFSET keywords, commonly found in MySQL or PostgreSQL, are not standard. For string concatenation, use the + operator. Date and time manipulation often relies on functions like GETDATE(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), and CONVERT(). Handle NULL values using IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, or functions like ISNULL(expression, replacement) and COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ...). While often case-insensitive by default depending on collation, it's best practice to match casing with database objects. Complex queries frequently leverage Common Table Expressions (CTEs) defined with WITH for readability and structuring multi-step logic. Pay close attention to correct spacing and keyword usage to avoid syntax errors.",
